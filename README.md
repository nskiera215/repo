This repository is a collection of projects and coding samples.

1. Royals R Coding Project:
     This project displays what I have learned over the course of the four years I spent at Williams College using R and analysis.
     It was a project given to me by the Royals to complete an analysis of throws to first base.
     Many of the skills used in this project include **Data Manipulation**, **Variable Creation**, **Statistical Modeling**, **Machine Learning**, etc.

3. Baseball Stats:
     This is a passion project for me as it is the first one I have completed on my own as a result of the Python class I am taking online at Coursera.
     It is a dashboard that prompts for a baseball player and year and returns their stats as well as a brief summarization of those stats.
